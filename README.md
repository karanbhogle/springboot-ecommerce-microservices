# Ecommerce Project using Spring Boot, Redis, Kong, Apache Kafka, andÂ MongoDB

This is a multi-module microservice Spring Boot project. Used Redis for caching product-service data, Kong for API Gateway, Apache Kafka for notifying mail-service about the confirmed order and MongoDB for storing data.

## Setup and Installation
1. Install WSL2 Ubuntu, if you're using Windows.
2. Open the Ubuntu Terminal and [install Kong](https://konghq.com/install) and [Redis Server](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-redis/install-redis-on-windows/).
3. Run Kong and Redis server.
4. Run Apache Kafka and create topic named "order-confirmation-events" for notifying mail-service.
5. On Kong, you need to create Gateway Services and routes for all the endpoints of all the microservices. ![Alt Text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*hPK7UjIGMCsrpZsIYOCx0g.jpeg)
6. On Kong, install Key Authentication plugin and create Consumer and it's credentials. Configure the scope as Global to allow authentic users only. Copy the key and use that key to send requests.
